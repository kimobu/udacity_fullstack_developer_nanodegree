# udacity-linux-server-configuration
This repo contains a README which lists the commands/procedures needed to fulfill the requirements of Udacity's Linux Server Configuration project. The purpose of this project is to set up a Linux server to host a Flask web application.

## Create a new user named grader
User was graded using `useradd grader`. Password was set using `passwd grader`. To create SSH keys that will be used for authentication, I used `ssh-keygen` as that user.
## Give the grader the permission to sudo
`visudo` allows you to edit the /etc/sudoers file. The following was added: 
>grader  ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL

## Update all currently installed packages
`apt update` to update the metadata, `apt upgrade` to perform the updates, `reboot` to apply kernel changes
##Change the SSH port from 22 to 2200
Edit /etc/ssh/sshd_config 
>Port 2200

## Configure the Uncomplicated Firewall (UFW) to only allow incoming connections for SSH (port 2200), HTTP (port 80), and NTP (port 123)
`ufw allow 2200; ufw allow 123; ufw allow 80`
## Configure the local timezone to UTC
`dpkg-reconfigure tzdata` and select UTC
## Install and configure Apache to serve a Python mod_wsgi application
`apt install apache2 libapache2-mod-wsgi`
## Install and configure PostgreSQL:
`apt install postgresql`. 
## Do not allow remote connections
Postgres is listening only on localhost by default.
### Create a new user named catalog that has limited permissions to your catalog application database

    Switch to the postgres user with `su - postgres` then run `psql`. 
    Add the user with `create user catalog with password 'Add the database with '5PUURTKV5Wsr';`. 
    Create the database with `create database catalog;` then give permissions to the user `grant all privileges on database catalog to catalog;`.
    
## Install git, clone and setup your Catalog App project (from your GitHub repository from earlier in the Nanodegree program) so that it functions correctly when visiting your serverâ€™s IP address in a browser. Remember to set this up appropriately so that your .git directory is not publicly accessible via a browser!

Created an apache config file for the site that looks like:

    <VirtualHost *:80>
        ServerName 52.24.183.0
        ServerAlias ec2-52-24-183-0.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com
        ServerAdmin webmaster@localhost
        WSGIScriptAlias / /var/www/catalog/flaskapp.wsgi
        <Directory /var/www/catalog/catalog/>
            Order allow,deny
            Allow from all
        </Directory>
        Alias /static /var/www/catalog/catalog/static
        <Directory /var/www/catalog/catalog/static/>
            Order allow,deny
            Allow from all
        </Directory>
        ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log
        LogLevel warn
        CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log combined
    </VirtualHost>

Clone the project:
`cd /var/www; git clone git@github.com:kimobu/fullstack-item-catalog.git`. Renamed the fullstack-item-catalog directory to catalog, then moved the catalog directory from catalog/vagrant up a directory. Within /var/www/catalog, created a config file for WSGI:

    #!/usr/bin/python
    import sys
    sys.path.insert(0,"/var/www/catalog/")
    
    from catalog import app as application
    application.secret_key = '3GblcjPrbpQzo8jYOKRj'
    
Had to install pip by downloading and running get_pip.py, then installed dependencies for the application:

    pip install flask
    pip install sqlalchemy
    apt install postgresql-server-dev-9.3
    pip install psycopg2
    pip install oauth2client


Finally, edited /etc/ssh/sshd_config again to disallow root login by setting
> PermitRootLogin no
